## Overview

**lolMiner** is a high-performance, multi-algorithm GPU miner. It enables mining of various cryptocurrencies including
Ergo (ERG), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Kaspa (KAS), Ravencoin (RVN), Flux (FLUX), and many more.

### Supported Algorithms & Coins

| Algorithm   | Coin                   | Dev Fee |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
| AUTOLYKOS2  | Ergo (ERG)             | 1.5%    |
| ETCHASH     | Ethereum Classic (ETC) | 0.7%    |
| KARLSENHASH | Kaspa (KAS)            | 0.75%   |
| KAWPOW      | Ravencoin (RVN)        | 1.0%    |
| ZelHash     | Flux (FLUX)            | 1.0%    |
| BEAM-III    | Beam (BEAM)            | 1.0%    |
| FIROPOW     | Firo (FIRO)            | 1.0%    |

See the [lolMiner GitHub](https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases) for the full list of 30+ supported
algorithms.

## Configuration

When deploying the recipe, you'll need to provide:

- **Container Group Name** (required) - Unique identifier for your deployment (2-63 lowercase letters, numbers, or
  hyphens)
- **Algorithm** (required) - Mining algorithm (e.g., `AUTOLYKOS2`, `ETCHASH`, `KAWPOW`). Defaults to `AUTOLYKOS2`
- **Pool URL** (required) - Pool address with protocol (e.g., `stratum+tcp://ergo.2miners.com:8888`)
- **Wallet Address** (required) - Your wallet address for the coin being mined
- **Worker Name** (optional) - Custom worker name
- **Extra Arguments** (optional) - Additional lolMiner command-line arguments

## Example Pool URLs

| Coin      | Pool       | URL                                       |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Ergo      | 2miners    | `stratum+tcp://ergo.2miners.com:8888`     |
| Ergo      | Herominers | `stratum+tcp://ergo.herominers.com:10250` |
| ETC       | 2miners    | `stratum+tcp://etc.2miners.com:1010`      |
| Ravencoin | 2miners    | `stratum+tcp://rvn.2miners.com:6060`      |
| Kaspa     | acc-pool   | `stratum+tcp://kas.acc-pool.pw:16061`     |
| Flux      | 2miners    | `stratum+tcp://flux.2miners.com:9090`     |

## How To Use This Recipe

### Prerequisites

1. A cryptocurrency wallet address for the coin you want to mine
2. Choose a mining pool that supports your chosen algorithm/coin

### Deploy the Recipe

1. Open the **lolMiner GPU Miner** recipe in the [SaladCloud Portal](https://portal.salad.com) when creating a new
   container group.
2. Enter a container group name.
3. Select your mining algorithm (defaults to AUTOLYKOS2 for Ergo).
4. Enter your pool URL with the protocol prefix (`stratum+tcp://` or `stratum+ssl://`).
5. Enter your wallet address.
6. Optionally set a worker name and any extra arguments.
7. Deploy the container group.

### Checking Hashrate

The miner outputs hashrate and share statistics to the container logs. Check the SaladCloud Portal logs for real-time
output from your mining nodes.

### Replica Count

The recipe is configured for 3 replicas by default. For production mining operations, consider increasing the replica
count to maximize your hashrate. SaladCloud's distributed GPU cloud allows you to scale to thousands of nodes.

## Mining Payouts

Mining rewards are paid directly to your wallet by the mining pool:

1. Your miner submits shares to the pool as proof of work.
2. When the pool finds a block, rewards are distributed based on shares contributed.
3. Each pool has a minimum payout threshold (e.g., 0.5 ERG on 2miners).
4. Once your balance reaches the threshold, the pool automatically sends coins to your wallet.

Check your mining progress and balance on the pool's dashboard by searching for your wallet address.

## Troubleshooting

### Low Hashrate

- Ensure you're using GPUs with sufficient VRAM for the algorithm
- AUTOLYKOS2 (Ergo): 4GB+ VRAM recommended
- ETCHASH (ETC): 4GB+ VRAM required
- KAWPOW (RVN): 4GB+ VRAM required

### Connection Errors

- Verify the pool URL format includes protocol: `stratum+tcp://` or `stratum+ssl://`
- Check if the pool is online
- Try an alternative pool server

### Invalid Shares

- Ensure your wallet address is valid for the coin being mined
- Check that the algorithm matches the coin/pool
