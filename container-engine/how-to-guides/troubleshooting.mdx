_Last Updated: February 5, 2026_

The following guide addresses common issues encountered when running container workloads on Salad. These solutions will
help resolve frequent problems with downloads, container failures, networking, and access. If issues persist after
applying these fixes, please consult our documentation or contact support.

## My Container Group Can't Pull My Image

If your container group is unable to pull your container image, try the following steps:

- Verify the image url is correct. Check for typos in the image name and registry.
- If using a private registry, ensure that the credentials provided are valid and have the necessary permissions,
  including inspecting the manifest and downloading all of the layers. Ensure there are no leading or training
  whitespace characters in your credentials.
- If using a private registry, ensure your account level supports an adequate rate limit for the number of container
  groups you are deploying. This is especially important if you are using Docker Hub, and deploying many single-replica
  container groups.
- Ensure the image is in Docker/OCI format and built for AMD64 architecture. Salad does not support ARM64 images.
- Ensure the image size is \<= 35GB (compressed). Larger images will fail to pull.
- If using a custom registry, ensure that the registry is publicly accessible from the internet.

## My Container Group Loops Between Downloading and Allocating

If you see your container group repeatedly transitioning between "Downloading" and "Allocating", this almost always
indicates that the container is failing immediately when it starts. In this case, Salad will attempt to restart the
container on the same machine to minimize downtime. After repeated failures we will reallocate the workload to a
different node. To confirm this is what is happening, you can check the System Events tab for a container group, which
will show things like when an instance started downloading, and exit codes. Alternately you can use the log explorer to
search for `resource.type=instance_controller`.

## Container Exit Troubleshooting

### `Exited:0`: Successful Exit

An exit code of `0` indicates the container process completed successfully. This is expected behavior for many base
images (for example, `ubuntu`) which exit immediately if no long-running command is specified. **Containers, unlike VMs,
require a long-running process to stay alive.**

**Recommended action:** If the container is intended to remain running, specify a long-running command such as:
`sleep infinity`, or a large integer value for distributions where `sleep` does not support `infinity` (e.g. Alpine
Linux).

### `Exited:137`: Container Killed (SIGKILL)

Exit code `137` indicates the container was terminated with `SIGKILL`. This typically happens when the container exceeds
its memory limit, and is killed as OOM (out-of-memory). A 137 exit code can also be recorded if the container instance
was explicitly terminated (for example, via the IMDS endpoint).

**Recommended actions:** Verify whether a termination was requested intentionally. If not increase the memory allocated
to the container group if the exit is unexpected.

### `Exited:<other>`: Application-Specific Exit

Exit codes other than `0` or `137` are typically returned by the application running inside the container. For example,
1 is a common exit code for general application errors, and 2 is a common exit code for invalid arguments or
configuration.

**Recommended actions:** Inspect the container logs immediately preceding the exit to determine the root cause. Validate
application configuration, input files, and environment variables.

### `StartFailure:-1`: Container Failed to Start

A `StartFailure` indicates that the container runtime was unable to start the container. In these cases, the container
process itself never executed. Start failures may occasionally be caused by transient node-level issues. However,
repeated start failures typically indicate a problem with the container image or container group configuration.

#### Image and Runtime Issues

- Invalid or missing container entrypoint
- Image built for an incompatible architecture
- GPU images with missing or incompatible CUDA libraries

#### Command and Argument Errors

- Incorrect command or arguments
- Referenced files or binaries do not exist in the image
- Incorrect assumptions about the working directory

#### GPU and Resource Mismatches

- Using a non-GPU container image with a GPU container group
- Using a GPU-dependent image in a CPU-only container group
- CUDA version incompatibility between the image and host drivers

### Debugging Start Failures

To systematically debug start failures:

1. Verify the container image works locally with a similar runtime environment (e.g. Docker Desktop).
2. Ensure the container image is intended for GPU workloads if deploying to a GPU container group, or vice versa.
3. Start the container with a minimal long-running command such as `sleep infinity` and connect via the terminal in the
   Portal or with SSH. Once connected, manually verify that the expected files, binaries, and environment variables are
   present and correct. Also verify that the intended entrypoint or command run successfully.

## My Container Group Is Stuck Downloading / Stuck at Downloading 99%

First, check the instances are not looping between downloading and allocating as above. However, if a single node has
been in the "Downloading" state for a long time (more than 2 minutes per GB of image size), you may have landed on a
node with below-average network performance. This can happen because Salad nodes often run on residential internet
connections, where other household devices may share the bandwidth. Many of these nodes will eventually become healthy,
but if high network performance is essential to your application, try reallocating the node. It will be placed on a
different machine, with different network conditions.

_Note that the progress bar is a conservative estimate — actual download time may vary._

## My Container Group Is Running But I Get 503 Errors With The Container Gateway

- Ensure your container is listening on the correct port. The port you specify in the Salad configuration must match the
  port your application is listening on inside the container.
- Ensure your container supports [IPv6](/container-engine/how-to-guides/gateway/enabling-ipv6#enabling-ipv6). Salad
  Gateway uses IPv6 to route traffic to your container. Enabling IPv6 is typically as easy as setting your host to `::`
  instead of `0.0.0.0`.
- Ensure your [readiness probe](/container-engine/explanation/infrastructure-platform/readiness-probes) does not pass
  until the server is able to accept traffic. If the readiness probe passes before the server is ready, Salad Gateway
  will route traffic to the container, but the container may not be able to handle it yet, resulting in 503 errors.
- Ensure at least one node is running and "ready" in the Salad portal. If all nodes are down, or not ready, the gateway
  will return 503 errors.

## My Container Group Is Running But I Get 403 Errors With The Container Gateway

- If your container group has Authentication enabled, ensure that your Salad API Key is valid, and included in the
  `Salad-Api-Key` header of your requests.
- If your container group does not have Authentication enabled but you are getting 403 errors, this issue can occur in
  rare cases due to an internal delay creating the necessary route tables. This usually resolves itself within a few
  minutes. If it does not, please contact support. In this scenario, duplicating the container group will almost always
  resolve the issue, but please contact support anyway, so we can track the issue and continue to improve.

## My Container Group Is Running But I Can't Access It With The Web Terminal

- Wait a few seconds after the terminal page loads, as it sometimes takes a moment to establish a connection.
- Refresh the page if it does not connect after a few seconds.
- You may also gain terminal access to nodes using tools like
  [tailscale ssh](/container-engine/how-to-guides/platform-integrations/tailscale-basic), or even
  [installing the VS Code server](/container-engine/tutorials/development-tools/vscode-remote-development) or JupyterLab
  in your container image.
